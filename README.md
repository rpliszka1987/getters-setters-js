## Description

This is a JavaScript practie file of creating getters and setter for objects. In this file I am setting robot properties of a robot object using setter, and retriving the information using getters. We also use the private properties for the object which are the reason why they start with the underscore (\_). They can only be changed using the setter property of the object.

## Meal Maker

This is a JS application which is used for setting daily restaurant specials. I used creating a menu object which holds the price and name of the special. Then used setter to set the object properties. Followed by setting up setters to retrive the properties from the menu obj. This was an excercise from Code Academy to practice getters and setters.,

## Team Stats

This is a JS application which is used to keep team scores and players rosters. There are objects which are storing players infomation such as first name, last name, and age. Created a games which store opponents, team points, and opponents points to keep score of previous games. Finally there are two getters which one gets all the players and other gets the games. Last part of the application are team methods which one is to addPlayer() and addGame(), which allows to add additional games and rosters to the object. This is a excercise from Code Academy which is to practice setters and getters.
