# Getters and Setters JavaScript

## Description

This is a JavaScript practie file of creating getters and setter for objects. In this file I am setting robot properties of a robot object using setter, and retriving the information using getters. We also use the private properties for the object which are the reason why they start with the underscore (\_). They can only be changed using the setter property of the object.

This is a JS application which is used for setting daily restaurant specials. I used creating a menu object which holds the price and name of the special. Then used setter to set the object properties. Followed by setting up setters to retrive the properties from the menu obj. This was an excercise from Code Academy to practice getters and setters.,
