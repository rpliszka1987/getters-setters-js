# Getters and Setters JavaScript

## Description

This is a JavaScript practie file of creating getters and setter for objects. In this file I am setting robot properties of a robot object using setter, and retriving the information using getters. We also use the private properties for the object which are the reason why they start with the underscore (\_). They can only be changed using the setter property of the object.
